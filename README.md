# Predicting Public Transit Ridership Fluctuations using Social Media Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to improve the efficiency and resource allocation of public transit systems by predicting ridership fluctuations.  We achieve this by analyzing real-time social media sentiment related to public transit services. The analysis leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to gauge public opinion and correlate it with historical ridership data to build a predictive model. This model can then be used to anticipate periods of high or low demand, allowing transit authorities to optimize scheduling and resource deployment.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Tweepy (or other relevant social media API library)


## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:**  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`

This will execute the sentiment analysis, predictive modeling, and output generation.  Ensure you have the necessary API keys and tokens for accessing the social media data (if applicable, details may be in a separate configuration file).

## Example Output

The script will print a summary of the analysis to the console, including key performance indicators (KPIs) of the predictive model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).  Additionally, the project generates several visualization files (e.g., plots showing sentiment trends over time, correlation between sentiment and ridership). These plots are saved in the `output` directory.  Example output files include:

* `sentiment_trend.png` (Illustrative example, actual filename may vary)
* `ridership_prediction.png` (Illustrative example, actual filename may vary)
* `model_performance.txt` (Summary of model performance metrics)
